# Three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. 

1. The linear regression model run for Capomulin suggests a **positive correlation** between mouse weight and average tumor size. (The r-value = 0.84 and the r-squared = 0.71)

2. Ramicane had summary statistics and timepoint data similar to Capomulin, which may warrant further investigation of **Ramicane's efficacy**.  

3. Mouse distribution by sex is 49% female and 51% male, which is **close to the theoretical 50/50 distribution** we would expect by nature. Hence our sample does not seem to be skewed by mouse sex.
